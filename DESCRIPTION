Language: Python 3 (I used python 3.7, but 3.6 should be new enough)

Tools: ply (python lex+yacc library), llvmlite (llvm code generation), the llvm
compiler (llc), and gcc (for linking against libc).

Everything in the language is implemented as far as I know. (Except passing
arrays to functions which I believe was considered optional).

Code Generation:
** Expression work
** Loops work
** Conditionals work
** Assignment and exchanges work for arbitrarily complex tuple things.
** Functions work (take tuple -> tuple) and support recursion.
** Arrays work (and also looping over arrays)
