Running the Code
----------------

The scanner code is in scan.py.

Use python3 to run it as follows: python3 scan.py <input>

<input> is an optional parameter that gives the filename to scan. If <input> is not given, the scanner will scan from stdin.

Sample Input
------------

The sample inputs and their outputs are in the txt/ directory. The inputs are named *.txt and the outputs are the correspondingly named files with the *.out.txt extension.
