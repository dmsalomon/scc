| Running the Checker |
-----------------------

The code is in check.py.
Use python3 to run it as follows: python3 check.py <input>
<input> is an optional parameter that gives the filename to check. If <input> is not given, the parser will parse from stdin. If using stdin, give <eof> (using <ctrl-d> on unix) to end input.

If an error is encountered while parsing, the parser will immediately report the error to stdout by specifying the offending token (or complaining that <eof> arrived unexpectedly).

-----------------
| Sample Inputs |
-----------------

The sample inputs and their outputs are in the txt/ directory. The inputs are named *.txt and the outputs are the correspondingly named files with the *.out.txt extension.
