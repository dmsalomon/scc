--------------------| Running the Code Generator |--------------------

The code is in `gen.py`.

It requires the llvmlite library and a relatively new version of python
3 (probably python 3.6 or newer, I used python 3.7).

Run it as follows: python3 gen.py <input>.

The file parameter is optional, in which case input will be read from stdin. If
all goes well, the output is an llvm ir file called `o.ll`. Run `make` to
compile `o.ll` into a binary called `o`. (You will need the llvm compiler `llc`
to compile, and `gcc` for linking against libc).

I have some sample programs in the txt/ directory using the .xx extension.

If you want to only run the previous stages of the compiler (i.e. only scanner,
or only checker+parser+scanner), you can do so by running the appropriate python
file (scan.py, parse.py, check.py). They are invoked in exactly the same as the
code generator.
